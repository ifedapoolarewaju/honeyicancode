title: Honey, I edited Python's Vars()
---

**Sam:** Hey Honey! How did grocery shopping go?

**Honey:** Gosh! It was super tedious! There was this long line to get in and it took forever to get to my turn.

**Sam:** Did you get toilet paper?

**Honey:** No Sam. Unfortunately the store is still out of toilet paper.

**Honey:** So what's up, how's your project going? \*Unpacks groceries\*

**Sam:** Lol! I was hoping you wouldn't ask ... yet.

**Honey:** Why? What's the matter? Did you run into infinite loops again?

**Sam:** Well I don't know what I ran into. But I hit an error not so long after you stepped out. And I've been stuck here since then.

**Honey:** Wow! I was out for quite a while. About 3 hours?

**Sam:** Yeah, if you came in about 45 minutes ago, you would've caught me having a raging conversation with my ~computer~ self. Cos it makes absolutely no sense that I'm getting this error.

**Honey:** Hmm, so what's this error you're getting?

**Sam:** Yeah, so I have this Python object that I'm trying to convert to JSON ...

**Honey:** Ok?

**Sam:** So to do that, I need to convert the object into a Dictionary right?

**Honey:** Yep! You could do that with `vars()` or the `__dict__` attribute.

**Sam:** Exactly! So I used the `vars()` function to convert the object into a Dictionary right?

**Honey:** Ok?

**Sam:** But the thing is, one of the feilds of the object is an object as well.

**Honey:** Ah I see! So you have to convert that field into a Dictionary as well eh?

**Sam:** Yeah, so I created an `as_dict()` function that would help me convert the object and its fields into a Dictionary.

**Honey:** Hmm, let me have a look at the object in question. \*Walks down to Sam's Computer*\

**Honey:** Yeah, I get it now. \*Heads back to unpacking groceries\*

**Honey:** So what's the problem with converting that object and its fields into a dictionary?

**Sam:** Well I'm not sure, but everything just seems to go to shit when I run the code.

**Sam:** Like for some reason I cannot access the XXXXXXX field anymore, and my server just crashes
